Description: This assignment required the implementation of a Red Black Tree from scratch in java.
Approach: For this assignment, I started by implementing a normal Binary Search Tree and made sure that adding
          and removing nodes worked properly. For the implementation of the BST, I did not use dummy leaf nodes.
          After this, I moved on to coloring the nodes using the enum I created for color. After making sure the coloring
          worked for adding nodes, I moved on to making sure dummy black nodes worked. After troubleshooting this, I finished up
          fixTreeAdd and Remove(with some difficulty). Later, I modularized my code and made sure things were more readable. 
Conclusions: One thing that I can definitely take away from this assignment is how much easier it was when I modularized my code.
             Being able to see each problem at a smaller scale and focus on fixing one issue at a time made the project much more
             manageable than writing a big chunk of code at once and trying to find problems in a big jumble of code. Another thing
             I have learned is how difficult it is to print out a binary tree in a pyramid fashion using the java console.
